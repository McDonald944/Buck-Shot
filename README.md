# Buck Shot - Fireside Gamejam 2025 Entry

**Made for:** Fireside Gamejam 2025
**Theme:** Hunting
**Submission Date:** May 04, 2025

Welcome to Buck Shot! Our entry for the Fireside Gamejam 2025, built around the theme of "Hunting". Get ready to test your aim in this simple, yet satisfying, artillery-style skill game.

## Overview

Buck Shot is a 2D physics-based hunting game designed for quick, replayable rounds and high-score chasing. Inspired by the classic trajectory gameplay of *Scorched Earth* and the satisfying physics of *Angry Birds*, we aimed to create a focused experience where precision and timing are key. Forget complex mechanics; this is all about lining up that perfect shot!

## Gameplay

1.  **The Setup:** You spawn on one side of a 2D landscape. Across the field, several deer targets appear.
2.  **Take Aim:** Control your weapon (could be a trusty rifle, maybe something... bigger?) to adjust the angle and power of your shot. Your projectile will follow a physics-based arc.
3.  **FIRE!** Launch your projectile and watch it fly. The goal is to hit the deer targets on the other side. Hitting the deer is the primary objective, and perhaps aiming for the bigger bucks yields a higher score!
4.  **They're Spooked!** Here's the twist: after each shot you take, a couple of the remaining deer will get scared and bolt off the map! You need to be strategic and efficient.
5.  **Round End:** The round concludes once all deer have either been successfully hit by your shots or have fled the area.
6.  **Tally Up:** An end screen displays your performance statistics for the round, including how many deer you hit, your shot accuracy, and your final score.
